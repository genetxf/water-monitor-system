## Objectives
1. Cut down on employment cost
2. Reduction of management cost
3. Increase management efficiency/accuracy through automation
## Features
This project will boast numerous features in managing fluid/water tanks both at consumer and industrial level.

- **Fluid level detection and control**\
An automated water level management system which will be assigned to adjusting water level in tanks.

- **Temperature detection and control**\
A sensor will detect and regulate temperature of fluid in tanks.

- **Flow/turbulence control**\
Pumps will regulate flow of fluid in and out of tanks.

- **pH sensor**\
In water tanks, pH sensors will detect pH levels and warn of any intolerance level reach.

- **Organic contaminant detection**\
A sensor(methane gas) will monitor organic contamination in tanks.

## Expected Impact
- Industries
  1. Increased production rate
  2. Management cost reduction
  3. Employment cost reduction
- Consumers
  1. Ease of use
  2. Ensuring of consumption safety
