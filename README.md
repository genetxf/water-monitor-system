## Objectives

1. Cut down on employment costs
2. Reduce management costs
3. Increase management efficiency and accuracy through automation

## Features

This project will include numerous features for managing fluid/water tanks at both the consumer and industrial levels.

- **Fluid Level Detection and Control**  
  An automated water level management system will adjust the water level in tanks.

- **Temperature Detection and Control**  
  A sensor will detect and regulate the temperature of the fluid in tanks.

- **Flow/Turbulence Control**  
  Pumps will regulate the flow of fluid in and out of tanks.

- **pH Sensor**  
  In water tanks, pH sensors will detect pH levels and warn of any intolerable levels.

- **Organic Contaminant Detection**  
  A sensor (methane gas) will monitor organic contamination in tanks.

## Expected Impact

### Industries
1. Increased production rate
2. Management cost reduction
3. Employment cost reduction

### Consumers
1. Ease of use
2. Ensured consumption safety
